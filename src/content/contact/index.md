About to graduate from my BSc in Videogames and Multimedia, and starting a new challenge as a Junior Full-stack developer.
I intend to pursue a Master's degree in Computer Science as soon as the pandemic eases. Meanwhile I'll keep improving my skills as a Developer and as a Game Programmer.

Whether you want to offer me an opportunity or just want to say hi, I'll try my best to answer asap!
